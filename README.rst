Asciigraf is a python library that turns ascii diagrams of networks into
network objects. It returns a `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`__
graph of nodes for each alpha-numeric element in the input text; nodes
are connected in the graph to match the edges represented in the diagram
by ``-``, ``/``, ``\`` and ``|``.

Installation
------------

Asciigraf can be installed from pypi using pip:

.. code::

    ~/$ pip install asciigraf

Usage
-----

Asciigraf expects a string containg a 2-d ascii diagram. Nodes can be an
alphanumeric string composed of words, sentences and punctuation (for a look at
what is all tested to work, see the `node recognition tests`_). Edges can be
composed of ``-``, ``/``, ``\`` and ``|``.

.. _node recognition tests: https://github.com/opusonesolutions/asciigraf/blob/master/tests/test_node_match.py

.. code:: python


    import asciigraf

    network = asciigraf.graph_from_ascii("""
              NodeA-----
                       |
                       |---NodeB
                                         """)

    print(network)
    >>> <networkx.classes.graph.Graph at 0x7f24c3a8b470>

    print(network.edges())
    >>> [('NodeA', 'NodeB')]

    print(network.nodes())
    >>> ['NodeA', 'NodeB']


Networkx provides tools to attach data to graphs, nodes and edges, and asciigraf
leverages these in a number of ways; in the example below you can see that
asciigraf uses this to attach a ``x, y`` position tuple to each node
indicating the line/col position of each node ( *0,0* is at the top-left).
It also attaches a ``length`` attribute
to each edge which matches the number of characters in that edge, as well
as a list of positions for each character an edge. In addition, the input data
is attached as a graph attribute ``ascii_string`` for reference.

.. code:: python

    print(network.nodes(data=True))
    >>> [('NodeA', {'position': (10, 1)}), ('NodeB', {'position': (23, 3)})]

    print(network.edges(data=True))
    >>> [('NodeA', 'NodeB', OrderedDict([('length', 10), 'points', [...]))]
    
    print(network.edge['NodeA']['NodeB']['points'])
    >>> [(15, 1), (16, 1), (17, 1), (18, 1),
         (19, 1), (19, 2), (19, 3), (20, 3), (21, 3), (22, 3)]

    print(network.graph["ascii_string"])
    >>>
        NodeA-----
                 |
                 |---NodeB


Asciigraf also lets you annotate the edges of graphs using in-line labels ---
denoted by parentheses. The contents of the label will be attached to the edge
on which it is drawn with the attribute name ``label``.

.. code:: python

    network = asciigraf.graph_from_ascii("""

        A---(nuts)----B----(string)---C
                      |
                      |
                      |
                      D---(pebbles)----E

    """)

    print(network.get_edge_data("A", "B")["label"])
    >>> nuts

    print(network.get_edge_data("B", "C")["label"])
    >>> string

    print(network.get_edge_data("D", "E")["label"])
    >>> pebbles

    print(hasattr(network.get_edge_data("B", "D"), "label"))
    >>> False
